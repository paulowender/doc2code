    - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    - üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
- Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export const foo = 'bar';
  
  // Instead of:
  const foo = 'bar';
  export { foo };
  ```
- Place imports in the following order:
  - Built-in Node modules (such as `path`)
  - External modules (such as `react`, `next`)
  - Internal modules (using relative paths)
- Place class properties in the following order:
  - Class methods and properties (methods starting with `static`)
  - Instance methods and properties
- Avoid platform-dependent code

### Documentation Styleguide

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) for documentation.
- Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
    - Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    - Reference instance methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
    - Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`
